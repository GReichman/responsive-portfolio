# My Portfolio 
By: Garrett Reichman

## Description
  This project was made to learn how bootstrap can be used to replace and enhance what I created using HTML and CSS. It is a website that can be used in the future (with some additions and changes) to allow prospective employers to view my information and projects that I have worked on. It contains a responsive home page with my photo and a short bio about myself, a page with links and re-sizing pictures connected to the projects I wish to display to employers, as well as a contact form to allow users to send me a message along with their email address and name.

## Usage
  Currently, the site allows a user to click the links in the navbar to move between the 3 pages. Future updates will allow the user to click the pictures on the portfolio page to view the projects displayed there, as well as the ability to send messages on the contact page.
